        <p class="mb-4">The Sona School of Business and Management (SSBM) has played a pivotal role in driving real-world change through its intensive research and advocacy focused on reducing road accidents in one of Tamil Nadu’s most dangerous stretches — the Thoppur Ghat Section.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">As part of a socially responsible initiative, SBM conducted a comprehensive analysis titled <strong>“Road Accidents in Thoppur”</strong>, presented in the presence of key stakeholders including the Deputy Superintendent of Police – Thoppur, Inspector of Police, Regional Transport Officers, Deputy Transport Commissioner, and L&T Toll Management officials. The report meticulously examined 10 years of accident data and offered insights into accident patterns, contributing factors, and potential prevention strategies.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Research Highlights and Insights</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">The report revealed some alarming statistics:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>473 accidents occurred within a 3 KM stretch of the Thoppur Ghat section.</li>
          <li>1 in every 4 accident injuries resulted in death, reflecting the severe nature of incidents.</li>
          <li>Weekends saw a surge in accidents, likely due to increased traffic and drunk driving.</li>
          <li>Vehicle design, especially those with a high center of gravity, contributed to rollover risks.</li>
          <li>A dedicated two-wheeler lane was suggested to reduce mixed traffic collisions.</li>
          <li>High penalties were recommended for accident-prone zones to improve discipline.</li>
          <li>Around 30% of accidents occurred on full moon or new moon days, indicating a need for scientific review of gravitational effects.</li>
          <li>Other key causes included poor road maintenance, sharp turns, and mechanical faults in vehicles that had undergone recent repairs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">From Research to Recognition and Action</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Based on feedback from officials, the report was refined and retitled <strong>“Towards Zero Accidents at Thoppur Ghat Section”</strong> and later presented to District Collector Tmt. D. Divyadharshini, who lauded the effort as “an impressive work.” The session concluded with several actionable proposals, many of which are now being explored or implemented by local authorities.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">A Major Milestone: Elevated Highway Project Sanctioned</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">In a remarkable development aligned with the report’s recommendations, the Central Government has approved <strong>₹905 crore</strong> for the construction of a much-needed elevated highway in Thoppur. This infrastructure upgrade aims to ease congestion, reduce fatal crashes, and transform Thoppur Ghat into a safer corridor for all commuters.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Driving Impact Beyond the Classroom</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">At Sona School of Business and Management, we believe in research with purpose. Our commitment to public safety, governance collaboration, and community welfare is a testament to our vision of education that creates impact beyond the classroom.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">We are proud to contribute — in even the smallest way — toward safer roads, smarter infrastructure, and stronger communities.</p>

    "content": "<div class=\"news-article mx-auto bg-white\">\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">The all important objective of technical education is to solve real problems. It is very important to note that the student who joins our institutions, need to be with the Final Placement Package of 15 to 20 Lakh Per Annum which is our target today.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">Education has never been as important as it is today. Good Education is worth its value in GOLD, in our case SONA, yes we have a 360 degree approach, which helps the student in overall learning. As we say in Sona <em>“Learning is a Celebration”</em>, the focus is on output and it is becoming more of experiential learning, which is a big challenge especially when students come from a background of Mugging. We have a detrain before we train; this process is called <strong>Mindset Engineering</strong> at Sona, where we work with our Medical College, Sona College of Naturopathy & Yoga. During the pandemic, we have built a model where Training happens from Mind Set, using our Yoga teachers to create a positive outlook. This has helped to improve self belief and has resulted in better outcomes.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">There is a huge focus on technology development after the pandemic as companies are looking at faster and larger numbers and more start-ups from us with higher packages. It is important that our students are like a <em>“Ready to Eat”</em>, as companies save huge on training cost & time. We are investing in the latest technology, our platform <strong>3T, Tomorrow’s Technology Today</strong> is built for the students of tomorrow.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML) and Analytics</strong> are opening up huge opportunities for the future. Sona focuses on creating students for the global environment. This also requires huge thrust in the area of changing technology. We keep on adopting at a very high level.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">As technology keeps changing, we need to change faster, our Board of Studies which consists of top industrialists & academicians review the curriculum & course content every 6 months. Our thrust towards <strong>Digital Engineering</strong> started way back in 2015 itself where we invested in Black Board, Lecture Capture System & in recent years Touch Screen Large Screens where a student learns 4W, 3H (What, Who, Where, When, How, How much & How long) has created thorough engineers who get the right outcome be it placements or starting their own companies.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">Evolving Engineering institutions will need to keep up to the industry requirement as the <strong>KFA (Key Focus Areas)</strong> keep changing.</p>\n</div>",
