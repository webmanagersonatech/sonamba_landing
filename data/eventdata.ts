    excerpt: "Exploring the timeless wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, this session highlighted its relevance to leadership, ethical decision-making, and conflict resolution in modern management.",
    description: "The Bhagavad Gita offers profound managerial lessons on duty, ethics, leadership, and decision-making, making it a valuable resource for contemporary management studies.",
    content: `<div class="news-article mx-auto">

  <p class="mb-4">In contemporary management, leaders seek novel approaches and enduring ideas to handle complex relationships. Among these, the <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong> stands out as a rich source of wisdom across time and culture. Known as the "Song of the Divine," it offers insights into ethical conduct, leadership, decision-making, and conflict resolution—critical for today’s corporate environment.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">The Gita presents a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna on the Kurukshetra battlefield. Krishna, acting as Arjuna’s charioteer and spiritual guide, advises him during a moral and existential crisis. This conversation provides managerial lessons that remain relevant even thousands of years later.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">A key principle of the Gita is <strong>dharma</strong>—duty or righteousness. In management, dharma emphasizes aligning actions with moral values and the greater good. Leaders who adhere to dharma foster trust, integrity, and purpose in their organizations. The Gita also stresses focus, clarity, and composure in decision-making—qualities essential for navigating today’s uncertain business landscape. By cultivating self-awareness and mindfulness, leaders can make strategic choices aligned with their values and vision.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">In summary, the Bhagavad Gita provides timeless guidance on ethical behavior, leadership, decision-making, and conflict resolution. Applying its principles enables executives to build organizations that are profitable, sustainable, and socially responsible, navigating the complexities of modern business with insight, integrity, and compassion.</p>
